# InstaKitchen

This is an android application with real-time pantry management, recipe search and an auto generated shopping list.

Sensors measure the weight of containers in the kitchen drawers and store this data in the Firebase cloud. This app presents a clear view of the quantity of ingredients present in the kitchen. If the quantity is very low, a shopping list is auto-generated assisting the user for his next visit to a supermarket.

In addition, the recipe search feature allows the user to search for their favourite recipes. The app also displays whether the user's kitchen has the ingredients mentioned in the recipe.
